# Assignment 1 

**Group 5:** Marwin Prenner & Marcel Dielacher

## Assignment details:
**Choose:** 
- 1 dataset (not big to save time for computation) 
- 1 ML algorithm (NN, SVM, RF â€¦ ) 
  
**Evaluate effectiveness and efficiency of ML algorithms trained in FL and:** 
- Train centralised model - as a baseline (try to reach the state of the art performance)
- Vary the number of nodes (clients) in FL and train models in Federated learning
- Evaluate the influence of different training parameters (e.g. federated cycles, local epochs) on effectiveness of the model 
  
**Compare results of federated learning vs. centralised Choose ONE of the following tasks:** 
1. Evaluate the influence of different data distribution in the nodes 
2. Evaluate 1 additional ML aggregation methods

## Overview:
This repository contains the **implementation** and **comparison** of a **centralized algorithm** and **Federated Learning** applied to a **lung cancer survey dataset**. The purpose is to evaluate and contrast the performance of these two approaches in the context of healthcare data analysis.

--------------------------
## Motivation:
Healthcare datasets, especially those related to diseases like lung cancer, are often **sensitive** and r**equire privacy and security considerations**. **Centralized algorithms** may pose challenges in handling such data due to privacy concerns. **Federated Learning**, on the other hand, offers a decentralized approach, allowing model training without centralized data storage.

The motivation behind this project is to assess the effectiveness and privacy implications of using Federated Learning compared to a traditional centralized algorithm in the context of lung cancer survey data.

--------------------------
## Data:
The effectiveness of cancer prediction system helps the people to know their cancer risk with low cost and it also helps the people to take the appropriate decision based on their cancer risk status. The data is collected from the website online lung cancer prediction system.
